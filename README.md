_Framing the Gaza Conflict Across Time and Political Contexts: A Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing Approach_

News media worldwide continue to play a decisive role in shaping narratives instrumentalized and perceived. Especially in the context of war and conflict, understanding interactions between political contexts and news framing is crucial in view of various national interests and public diplomacy – yet underrepresented in research. This paper aims to investigate differences in the framing of Gaza in news articles (N = 47,439) of 22 mainstream online news media, considering political contexts, analyzing text data from October 7, 2023 onwards. Benchmarking fine-tuned state-of-the-art transformer models allowed a dual-labeling approach of natural language processing tasks based on supervised machine learning to classify news articles. Findings reveal that media narratives partly align with news outlets’ national compliance. Moreover, news media with a democratic background differ from those with a non-democratic background on this matter. This paper emphasizes the strategic role of media in public diplomacy in the context of war.
